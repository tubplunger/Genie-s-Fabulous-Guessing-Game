None of this was really a challenge to set up, though something that gave me a bit of trouble was the UI. Mostly coding it correctly, getting it set up, and making it look somewhat nice for the game, as small as it is.

Originally, the button to restart the game was going to be the submit button, but the input box already worked with the enter key and I ended up needing a way to restart the game. Just ended up being redundant and it became the restart button.

For a game of this size, I believe that all of the code that I made could've been fit in one script rather than two seperate ones. For bigger games you will need multiple scripts, but here it could've been done with one I believe.
