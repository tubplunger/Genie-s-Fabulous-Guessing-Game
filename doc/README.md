Genie's Fabulous Guessing Game is a simple number game where the player needs to guess a certain number between 1-100. They are told if the number is too high or too low and once it is correct the game is over.

The game runs on two seperate scripts. The first one simply generates the random number and saves it for the game. The second script contains the rest of the game with the game determining if the number that is guessed is correct or not. It also interacts with the UI, allowing the player to use the input box until they get the number right before disabling the input box. At that moment it also enables a button that allows the player to restart the game.

To run the game you simply need to open up the executable file that should come with it in the repo. If it isn't there for whatever reason, just tell me.

For three improvements that I can think of: fix the background so that it fits on the screen correctly, add a point system determined by the number of attempts it takes the player to guess the number, and a way to close the game.
